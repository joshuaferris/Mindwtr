# Changelog

All notable changes to Mindwtr will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Project UX**: Unified the project details panel and collapsed project metadata by default.
- **Refactors**: Split sync, settings, project, task edit, attachment-sync, and cloud server modules to keep large files manageable.
- **Docs**: Refreshed MCP server documentation, contribution guidance, and context hierarchy notes.

### Fixed
- **Sync safety**: Ignored revision-only conflict noise, made pending remote-write cleanup explicit, repaired deleted parent references during merge, and hardened attachment URI sanitization.
- **Store integrity**: Validated task project/section/area references and surfaced save queue overflow details with dropped-version telemetry.
- **Capture & timers**: Allowed URL note values in quick add, stopped desktop audio capture via audio-context suspension, and restored mobile pomodoro session persistence.
- **Desktop polish**: Improved project task drag targeting, autosizing task descriptions, and agenda/focus virtualization behavior.
- **Mobile reliability**: Kept auto-sync active after layout updates and repaired post-split regressions.

## [0.7.7] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- **Cloud auth**: Prevented auth-failure rate limiting from collapsing unrelated clients into a shared bucket when proxy headers are not trusted.
- **Docker deploys**: Require explicit cloud auth tokens, pin Bun image tags, add compose resource limits, and harden container health checks.
- **Desktop sync**: Pause blur-triggered sync during task edits, always release offline listeners after sync failures, and guard native system-theme watcher cleanup.
- **Core merge**: Preserve ordering between two clamped future timestamps and lock current SQLite project-delete cascade behavior with regression coverage.
- **Mobile reliability**: Restored the task editor project field, hardened Android/OpenAI speech-to-text flows, and cleared stale mobile sync conflict stats after later sync errors.
- **MCP**: Cap `quickAdd` input length and align add-task quick-add validation with trimmed input handling.

### Changed
- **Desktop polish**: React to system theme changes more reliably, improve Obsidian scan compatibility, and detect Flathub analytics installs more accurately.
- **Docs & release tooling**: Clarified Docker cloud API support, refreshed sync docs, corrected French labels, and updated release automation checks.
